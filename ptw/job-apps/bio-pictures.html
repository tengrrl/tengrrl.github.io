<p>Any job application or workplace documents (like a LinkedIn profile picture) that you write need a professional photo that shows readers both what you look like and something about your personality and style. I know that none of you would use a bathroom mirror selfie like the one on the right, but based on what students have submitted in the past, I want to provide some specific guidelines.</p>
<h2>What to Wear</h2>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>Wear the kind of clothes that you would wear to work or to an interview. Be professional.</li>
  <li>If you are pursuing a military career or currently in the Corps, a photo in your uniform works for this assignment. </li>
  <li>Don’t use a photo in which you are wearing formalwear. Ring Dance or Wedding photos of you in a tux or a formal dress are not appropriate. Your readers will know you are trying to make-do with a photo that was clearly for another purpose. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Choose Your Setting</h2>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>Take your photo in a neutral location or in the kind of workplace where you hope to be employed. For instance, a photo on a construction site would be fine if you're a building construction major.</li>
  <li>Alternately, take your photo in a location that relates to your career. If you are a planning to be a veterinarian, you can take a photo with your horse in the stable or outside with your dog. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Eliminate Distractions</h2>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>Be sure there is nothing unusual in the background of your photo. Check for anything that is out of place. You want your readers to focus on you, not the background.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the photo focuses on you. Your significant other and friends do not belong in the photo. Crop out anything that doesn’t belong.</li>
</ul>
<h2>From the Virginia Tech Career Center</h2>
<p>Regarding photos, the Career Center explains on <a href="https://career.vt.edu/job-search/presenting_yourself/online-identity.html" target="_blank">its “Online Identity: LinkedIn &amp; More” page</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Employers are prohibited from making hiring decisions based on appearance or other factors not relevant to the job qualifications. However, employers do often cite &quot;professional appearance and demeanor&quot; as a job qualification, which is certainly relevant in many jobs.</p>
  <p>Photos are used in online professional networking, as in LinkedIn profiles. For LinkedIn, use a photo that shows a professional appearance, showing your face from the collar up, as you would appear in professional interview attire, not tank tops, t-shirts, sun dresses, party clothes and other non-professional attire.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Read More</h2>
<p>You will find a lot more useful tips in the step-by-step tutorial in the Hubspot post <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/professional-headshot-tips-for-budget" target="_blank">How to Take Your Own Professional Headshot: A Bookmarkable Guide</a>, which says it takes 15 minutes to read. The article covers everything from how to set up your camera to editing your final choice. </p>
<p>Take advantage of feedback from your writing group as well. If you can’t decide which photo is best, ask them to help you decide.</p>
